#graph_input.h
all functions are declared which include getParameter, getNodeList, getGraph, getInputInt, getInputString, getSouceNode, edgeExists, deleteEdge, deleteGraph.

#graph_input.c
all functions are defined here which will be further used in the graph algorithms.

#bellmanford.c
Bellmanford algorithm is used to compute the distance from one source to all other nodes and it is also applicable when distance between the nodes is negative. 
It first the assumes the cost to infinity then updates the cost using d[v] = d[u] + c[u, v] if it is less than previous iteration cost. Total number of iterations
are no. of vertices - 1.
It will not give correct result if the total sum of distance in a cycle is negative.
